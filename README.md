You must install PowerShell 2.0 before this script will work. 

Install by running xpfetch.bat as administator, or just running the xpfetch_ps.ps1 file directly in PowerShell. Once installed, the script can be ran by typing xpfetch in normal command prompt.

By default Windows XP has a super narrow max window width for Command Prompt. You will need to go through Properties -> Layout and change the buffer width.
