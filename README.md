You must install PowerShell 2.0 for this script to work. PowerShell 2.0 requires .NET 2.0 to also be installed.

Install by running xpfetch.bat as administator, or just running the xpfetch_ps.ps1 file directly in PowerShell. Once installed, the script can be ran by typing xpfetch in normal command prompt.

By default Windows XP has a super narrow max window width for Command Prompt. You will need to go through Properties -> Layout and change the buffer width. This is not necessary when running the script in PowerShell.

Here's an example image of the script running on my Precision M6300
